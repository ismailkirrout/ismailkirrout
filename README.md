I'm a **Computational Biologist**, passionate about using code to make sense of complex biological systems and human diseases. With a strong foundation in **molecular biology**, **immunology**, and **genomic data analysis**. I combine wet lab experience with programming to approach biology from both ends of the pipette.

## 🧬 About Me

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Biology** from the University of Alcalá (UAH), where I first discovered my interest in bioinformatics. This curiosity led me to pursue and recently complete a **Master’s in Computational Biology** at the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), where I specialized in:

- 🧬 Genomic data analysis, including comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.
- 📊 Statistical modeling & visualization tools
- 🤖 AI and machine learning in biology
- 💊 Computational tools for drug discovery

Throughout my academic journey, I've balanced hands-on experimentation with rigorous data analysis. My research at the **Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de la Princesa (IIS Princesa)** includes:

- 🧪 **Bachelor's Thesis**: Focused on immunology research with techniques like **flow cytometry, qPCR, protein quantification, and microscopy**, paired with **statistical analysis in R**.  
- 🧠 **Master’s Thesis**: A **genome-wide association study (GWAS)** on cardiovascular diseases using advanced **statistical and computational genomics** methods.

(📢 I presented part of my work on B cell surface proteins at the **45th SEMI Congress (2024)**).
